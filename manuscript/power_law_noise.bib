Reverberant rooms transition from deterministic behavior in the early field to stochastic behavior in the late field. Taking into account the limited time resolution of the auditory system and the asymptotically quadratic growth of reflection density in time, it is possible to define a critical time $t_c\propto\sqrt{V}$ where $V$ is room volume in cubic meters and $t_c$ is critical time in milliseconds after which there are a sufficient number of reflections in each time-resolution cell that the impulse response can be regarded as a realization of a nonstationary stochastic process consisting of stationary colored noise modulated by a frequency-dependent exponential envelope.10
