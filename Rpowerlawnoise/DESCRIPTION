Description: Power law noise is a time series where the energy at different
    frequencies is a function of the frequency raised to a power. True red
	noise has a power of -2, true white noise has a power of 0, and
	true violet noise has a power of 2. Pink noise has a power between -2 and
	0, exclusive. Blue noise has a power between 0 and 2, exclusive. There are
	many ways to generate power law noise. A particularly useful one uses an
	autoregressive model where the weights given to previous values of the time
	series are a function of the power and a decreasing function of the time
	lag to the term. Some powers have a fixed number of non-zero terms. White
	noise, for example, has no non-zero terms, and true red noise has only one.
	All other powers have a potentially infinite number of terms. The actual
	number of terms in an autoregressive model is its degree. Obviously, there
	are diminishing returns to increasing the degree of a model. This project
	is aimed at finding a rule for choosing how big a model's degree should be.
	The rule will be quantified according to the difference that one is willing
	to tolerate between the observed spectral slope and the expected slope of
	the spectrum of the time series.
